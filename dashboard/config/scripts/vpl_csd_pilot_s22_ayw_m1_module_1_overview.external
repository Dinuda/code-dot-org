# Module 1: CS Discoveries Virtual Professional Learning

## Module 1 Overview

##### The first two modules of the CS Discoveries professional learning program focus on the overarching theme of *debugging*. Debugging is a skill that is woven throughout all CS Discoveries units and reinforces problem-solving practices that students need to be successful in computer science.

##### In Module 1, you will have the opportunity to:

* ##### Build new knowledge related to the content covered in the synchronous Module 1 workshop.
* ##### Engage in activities and reflections to support students in learning new programming skills and problem solving to debug their code.

## How does this asynchronous work connect to the previous synchronous workshop?

##### During the synchronous call, you participated in a two-hour virtual workshop with your facilitators and cohort. This asynchronous work is designed to be an *extension* of that workshop to further your development in debugging. The following levels will build on what was previously introduced to you synchronously. Further, **the asynchronous portion of Module 1 is not a prerequisite for attending and engaging in your Module 2 synchronous workshop**.

##### **Suggested time**: 1 hour
